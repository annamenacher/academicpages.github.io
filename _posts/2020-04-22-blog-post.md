Exactly a week ago I have finished my second mini-project of the StatML CDT. Now I am officially starting my PhD. However, nothing much will change. I am still supervised by Thomas Nichols, Habib Ganjgahi and Chris Holmes where I am part of the Statistical Neuroimaging Group at the Oxford Big Data Institue. I am very much looking forward to the research I will get to do in the field of neuroimaging, particularly regaring neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis. This website will document some of the milestones along the way of pursuing research in statistics and brain imaging.
