Hello, I am Anna! I am a PhD student in Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford. I'm interested in all things related to Bayesian statistics, neuroimaging and machine learning. 

Currently, I am part of the first cohort of the StatML CDT between the University of Oxford and Imperial College London, supervised by [Thomas Nichols](https://www.nisox.org/) and [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/). My project on the analysis of multiple sclerosis is also part of a long-term collaboration between the [Oxford Big Data Institue](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/) and the pharmaceutical company Novartis. Previously, I studied at the University of Edinburgh where I was awarded with a Master of Science.
