During the first year of the [StatML](https://statml.io/) CDT I conducted reasearch in the form of two separate mini-projects under the supervision of [Thomas Nichols](https://www.nisox.org/), [Habib Ganjgahi](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=kBxjaFIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/). As I am now officially starting my PhD in the field of Bayesian statistics, machine learning and neuroimaging, I will be focusing on extending the mini-projects I have worked on in the previous year. 

Mini-Project No.1
======
- **Title:** Scalable Bayesian Spatial Model for Lesion Mapping of Multiple Sclerosis
- **Research Areas:** Bayesian Approximate Learning, EM Algorithm, Spatial Statistics, Longitudinal Data, Regression Modelling, Multiple Sclerosis

Mini-Project No.2
======
- **Title:** Scalar-on-image Regression Modelling for Brain Age Prediction with Application to the UK Biobank
- **Research Areas:** Multi-View Learning, Nonparametric Bayesian Statistics, Factor Analysis, Bayesian Approximate Learning, EM Algorithm, Scalable Gaussian Processes, Brain Age Prediction

Current PhD Project: 
======
- **Title:** Bayesian Lesion Estimation with a Structured Spike-and-Slab Prior (BLESS)
- **Research Areas:** Variational Inference, Spatial Statistics, Bayesian Regression Modelling, Spike-and-Slab, Variable Selection, Brain Lesion Mapping, High-dimensional Data, UK Biobank Application
