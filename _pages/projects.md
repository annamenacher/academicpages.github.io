During the first year of the [StatML](https://statml.io/) CDT I conducted reasearch in the form of two separate mini-projects under the supervision of [Thomas Nichols](https://www.nisox.org/), [Habib Ganjgahi](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=kBxjaFIAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/). As I am now officially starting my PhD in the field of Bayesian statistics, machine learning and neuroimaging, I will be focusing on extending the mini-projects I have worked on in the previous year.
